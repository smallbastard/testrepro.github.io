It's just a different thing, even if it is in the best way ever. And there are certain things that happen, and that you think when you start dating someone of the same sex for the first time. </p> <p> <strong> 1. You stress about labels</strong> . You might wonder if you should call yourself something like bisexual, queer, or heteroflexible. But really, it's up to you and you don't have to decide right away — or ever. It's also totally cool to not want to be labeled.</p> <p> <strong> 2. You wonder if flirting with a girl is the same as with a guy. </strong> You've had years of experience with cute boys, but when a cute girl comes into your life, you become this awkward human who forgets how to flirt with someone. And then you notice it's basically the same. (You're always a little awkward.)</p> View full post on Iframe <p> <strong> 3. You realize you don'</strong> <strong> t miss beard burn from kissing.</strong> Bye, stubbly skin! </p> <p> <strong> 4. You think way too much about how to tell people.</strong> You don't want everyone assuming you're just friends, but you also don't want to blurt out SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND like a crazy person to everyone you meet. </p> <span> </span> View full post on Tumblr <p> <strong> 5. You get annoyed when people ask if you'</strong> <strong> re going to date guys again.</strong> Maybe you will and maybe you won't, but when and if you do isn't up to anyone else. </p> <span> </span> View full post on Instagram <p> <strong> 6. You get excited about borrowing her clothes.</strong> At first it seems like double the closets. One month into your relationship, you realize you don't have the same style as your GF at all. Oops. </p> <p> <strong> 7. You see lesbian couples everywhere. </strong> How are you just noticing that they aren't all friends? </p> View full post on Iframe <p> <strong> 8. You're forced to have an awkward talk with a random family member.</strong> When your aunt from California comes to visit and starts asking why you and your friend are holding hands, it's time for some ~real talk~. </p> <p> <strong> 9. People ask you really inappropriate questions.</strong> All of a sudden people will think it's totally cool to ask really personal things, and you'll also feel like it's totally okay to say no and walk away. </p> <p> <strong> 10. You become a part of a really amazing community that always has your back.</strong> Because love is love is love is love </p> <p> <strong> Follow @Seventeen on Instagram.</strong> </p> <p> <span> </span> </p> <span> Elizabeth Denton</span> I'm Liz, the fashion and beauty girl at Seventeen.com.
