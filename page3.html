Photo by kevin laminto on Unsplash <p> For a long time, there is something I’ve wanted to try. I guess I knew since I was a teenager that I was attracted to girls, but it wasn’t “normal” for girls to date each other. I was attracted to boys, too, so that’s who I dated my whole life. </p> <p> Now, though, I’ve been thinking a lot about dating women again. There’s someone in my class — I really like her, we have a lot of fun talking together, and I think she’s beautiful. </p> <p> I’m an assertive person — in my life, I am ambitious and direct and pretty good at asking for what I want. So… I don’t understand why this is so hard. Honestly, I don’t even know where to start. </p> <p> How do you ask a woman out, as a woman? How does this even work? What if she thinks I’m creepy? What if I make her uncomfortable? What if she gets angry I thought she might be interested? </p> <p> I’ve heard a version of this story from friends, clients, and even strangers at dinner parties once they learn I’m a sex coach.</p> <p> It’s a good sign — we’ve come a long way with LGBTQ+ rights and acceptance. People feel more free to explore parts of their sexuality that, a generation ago, they may have kept hidden for fear of repercussions.</p> <p> What’s a person to do with these new found sexual freedoms? For many bisexual cis women, the possibility to date women presents a new and unexpected problem — how, exactly, do you date women as a woman?</p> <p> Here, I’m speaking specifically to bisexual cis women who have predominantly or only previously experienced heterosexual dating, sex, and relationships. While this essay will be generally useful to anyone dating human beings, I’m focusing on bisexual cis women directly.</p> <p> If that’s you, my shy bisexual sister, then let’s get started!</p> <h2> Where to begin?</h2> <p> First — a question: If a woman asked you out, even if you weren’t interested in dating her, how would you feel?</p> <p> Flattered? Anxious about saying no? Worried about what she might mean by that, and if it’s the same as what you want? Something else?</p> <p> When I ask this question to groups of women, all of them have said they would feel flattered to be asked out, even if they weren’t interested in dating the woman who asked.</p> <p> What a great place to start! Rejection is part of dating, regardless of your gender identity or sexual orientation. If you keep in mind that you’ve likely sparked positive feelings even when you receive a no, it takes the sting out of the experience.</p> <p> As this example attests, in all things dating, the place to begin is with you. Get clear about yourself — you wants, your needs, and your desires.</p> <p> Consider why you want to date women. What would this give you? What are you looking for? What are you looking forward to experiencing? What values are important to you, and important in a partner?</p> <p> Know what kinds of relationship you are looking for. Are you more interested in a casual partner, a friend with benefits, a life partner, a girlfriend, a polyamorous relationship, a kink relationship? Or, are you open to several different relationship types?</p> <p> Your needs, wants, and desires will become clearer over time, and they will change over time, too.</p> <p> The onus is on you to keep up with yourself. Make time to check in with yourself regularly — set a weekly appointment in your calendar to reflect on your desires.</p> <h2> Meeting Others</h2> <p> Think about where you have met partners in the past.</p> <p> What worked and what didn’t? Are any of these venues or methods interesting for you in your life now?</p> <p> There’s no limit to the variety of places where you can meet partners. With that said, if you’re not sure where to start, then start with online dating, meetups, or your personal network.</p> <p> While there’s plenty of valid frustration associated with online dating, one huge advantage is that people indicate on their profile if they’re interested in dating women and what they’re looking for from dating.</p> <p> You can’t beat online dating for directness and the context it provides.</p> <p> Craft a dating profile that accurately reflects your wants, needs, and desires. Be direct! Others will appreciate the lack of ambiguity on your dating profile the same way you would appreciate theirs.</p> <p> Personally, OK Cupid is my number one choice when it comes to online queer dating. OK Cupid is inclusive — many orientations, genders, and relationship preferences have preset (and easily searchable!) categories. While OK Cupid has a relatively small pool of users in some locations, it’s worth checking before moving on to other apps.</p> <p> After online dating, meet ups are your next best bet for meeting compatible people. Meetup.com is the best dating site in the world, and it’s not even a dating site! Take a look at the meet ups available to you, and pick one or two on topics that are of real interest to you.</p> <p> When you go to a meet up, you can relax and enjoy yourself because you’re doing an activity you’d choose to do anyway. Whether or not you meet a potential partner, you’ll have a good time.</p> <p> Being assured of a positive experience either way is at the core of something I call Outcome Independence. Outcome Independence is great for everyone when it comes to dating — you feel less pressure and anxiety, and that makes you more attractive to other people.</p> <p> Anyone you meet through a meet up will already have something in common with you. You’ll have something to talk about and the pleasure of indulging in a shared interest. You’ll make new friends, have fun, and grow because you’re engaging in things you genuinely care about. And, more often than not, with time you will meet people you’d be interested in dating, too.</p> <p> One type of group to consider in particular are feminist or LGBTQ+ meet ups, organizations, or clubs, provided that you are interested in feminism or LGBTQ+ rights. Being around other queer people is refreshing. It’s an opportunity to see other models of dating and relationships and to ask questions as you explore your orientation. In these groups, you also have a space to discuss your worries about being ‘out’ and receive support.</p> <p> And, if you happen to meet someone you’d be interested in dating, they won’t be surprised that you’re interested in someone with the same gender identity.</p> <p> It is worth noting that discrimination against bisexual people does occur in some LGBTQ+ communities , though that is a topic for another day. Suffice to say that, while this discrimination exists, it often manifests differently to discrimination in heterosexual contexts.</p> <p> Finally, don’t forget about using the network effect and meeting potential partners through your friends.</p> <p> Your friends know you well, they know what you’re like and what you like to do. Your extended network is a powerful way to meet people. Let your friends know you are looking to date women.</p> <p> Your friends can open up the possibility to meet people you never would have met otherwise, though sometimes your friends can get it totally wrong.</p> <p> Regardless of how you meet partners, remember — if you’re in doubt, come back to yourself and check in with you!</p> <h2> You met someone ! Now what?</h2> <p> Our cultural models for beginning relationships often cast women in a passive role. There are few portrayals of women meeting and approaching women in popular media. Most of the time, lesbian or bisexual characters are introduced as already having a partner and the meeting is a mystery.</p> <p> Now — it doesn’t need to be!</p> <p> Approaching potential partners is as simple as ABC: Asking, Boundaries, and Clarity.</p> <p> Let’s take this backwards and start off looking at a sample script you can use to ask a woman on a date. This script works face to face and via text:</p> <p> “Hey :) Can I ask you a question? [IF YES] I think you are really interesting and I would like to get to know you better. Would you like to go on a coffee date with me? It is totally fine if your answer is no :) [IF YES] Awesome! How about Thursday from 7pm–9pm?” </p> <p> Now, let’s break this down.</p> <h2> Asking</h2> <p> First, there’s Asking. Start out as you mean to go on — if you set a precedent of asking for what you want where no is a valid answer, you clear the way for a relationship built on the open communication of desire.</p> <p> Use “Can I?” as a question opener and honor the answer you receive. What you’re doing here is modelling that you care about what she wants, too, and that you will listen to her response. If you begin with “Can I ask you a question?” and the answer is no, stop there and move on to something else.</p> <p> Most of the time, the answer will be yes.</p> <p> While this seems a bit redundant, it also helps the person you are asking out to know that a question is coming and to focus their attention on what you are about to say.</p> <p> Then, simply and plainly, state your interest and ask if they’d like to go on a date. In this example, “ I think you are really interesting and I would like to get to know you better. Would you like to go on a coffee date with me? It is totally fine if your answer is no :)” you round out your ask by stating directly that No is a welcome answer.</p> <p> No matter how small, recognize and listen to No. In fact, the best response if she says No is “Thank you.” You’re thanking her for being honest, for taking care of herself, and for saving you time that could be spent with someone else who really wants to go out with you.</p> <p> Remember — if someone can’t say no, then you can never trust their yes.</p> <p> Women often wonder if this is a bit excessive. Why should you have to explicitly say that No is a fine answer? Isn’t that a bit… patronizing? Of course she can say no, she’s an adult!</p> <p> Think about it. How easy is it for you to say no? If the tables were turned, how would you feel if someone clearly showed interest in you and let you know there were no expectations you’d feel the same way?</p> <p> It’s a relief, right? It’s brave of them, too, isn’t it?</p> <p> Also consider what it feels like for you to hear no. It can be awkward, can’t it? What are you supposed to say next? Do you just shuffle in place, or excuse yourself and walk away? The power in responding to no with thank you lies in smoothing the interaction. Thank you acknowledges the No and allows you to move on to something else.</p> <h2> Boundaries</h2> <p> Next, let’s take a look at Boundaries and how they take pressure off of you and your potential date.</p> <p> In the example, “ How about Thursday from 7pm–9pm?” sets a clear boundary around time. When you are building a relationship with someone new, time boundaries are an easy way to begin building trust by demonstrating integrity.</p> <p> Time limit you first date and then <strong> stick to that time limit</strong> . Sounds good in theory. The challenge comes in when you really hit it off on a first date, and time seems to fly by. Before you know it, it’s 8:50pm… What do you do then?</p> <p> You stick to the boundary.</p> <p> Wrap up the date — a great way to do this is to express your interest in a second date and either agree the day and time then and there, or agree who will initiate setting the date.</p> <p> By discussing the second date at the end of the first date, you do everyone a favor. You learn then and there if they’re interested in meeting again, and if so, when the meeting can take place. You avoid putting your life on hold waiting around for calls, texts, or emails.</p> <p> Boundaries are the antidote for the agony of post-date limbo.</p> <p> What’s more, it’s always better to leave an interaction wanting more than to leave feeling like you got too much. By honoring the boundary you set, you demonstrate to your partner that she can trust you to honor her boundaries in the future. It makes it easier to say yes — not just to dates, but to all manner of experimentation and exploration together.</p> <h2> Clarity</h2> <p> Finally, we come to clarity: the cornerstone of confidence in dating.</p> <p> Despite the fact that we’re all adults here, clarity is often lacking in dating, sex, and relationships. Even with the best intentions, many such interactions are shrouded in ambiguity.</p> <p> Why do you think that is?</p> <p> Maybe you’ve had a hard time asking for what you want, too.</p> <p> What blocks you? What do you stand to lose by practicing clarity?</p> <p> For a great many people, the fear of rejection is the biggest block. Expressing your desires clearly, with no room for plausible denial, is incredibly vulnerable.</p> <p> But, think about this — in our busy world, clarity is a ninja skill that benefits EVERYONE — you, your dates, your partners, even your friends — because <strong> clarity saves time</strong> .</p> <p> To get the maximal benefit, you need both internal clarity and expressed clarity.</p> <p> Internal clarity comes from exploring what you want or are open to experiencing. You do this, as suggested earlier, by regularly taking the time to check in with yourself.</p> <p> Sometimes, you won’t fully know what you want. That’s normal. Accept and embrace those times when you’re working on figuring it out and be prepared to share that up front.</p> <p> Expressed clarity is when you take that internal knowing and communicate it to the women you are interested in dating. In this example, “ Would you like to go on a coffee date with me?” makes it clear you are asking for a date.</p> <p> You might be thinking to yourself — couldn’t I just ask her out for coffee, without saying it’s a date? Or — maybe I could ask her to meet up to go hiking together.</p> <p> The reason it feels so much more comfortable to leave out the word ‘date’ is because you’re leaving yourself an out and minimizing the perceived risk of rejection.</p> <p> This is a false promise. <strong> You’re not so much preventing rejection with this tactic as you are delaying it indefinitely</strong> . When you’re not clear, you are far less likely to have the experience you are hoping for. I can’t emphasize enough how often this is death for many promising bisexual girl crushes.</p> <p> Why?</p> <p> In our culture, most of the rejection risk-taking is done by men in heterosexual relationships. We’re all influenced in various ways by heteronormativity, and dating women as a woman is no exception. You may have grown up learning your role in dating and sex was to wait for the man to make a move. You may have even learned being direct as a woman was unattractive.</p> <p> I’ve seen it happen too many times where a crush between two women was mutual, but neither felt able to initiate. Sometimes this goes on for years, many coffees are had and many hikes are hiked, and it goes no further despite both people secretly desiring sex or romance.</p> <p> At some point, someone has to take a risk. You can’t control other people’s actions. Since you can only control yourself, the risk-taker may as well be you!</p> <p> If your desires are primarily to meet other women for casual sex, clarity becomes even more important. You need to share your desires ahead of time and give your potential partner a clear opportunity to say no. Otherwise, you risk misunderstanding and creepiness when previously unspoken sexual intentions are inferred.</p> <h2> Safer Sex</h2> <p> If you’ve only ever had sex with men, you might have no idea where to start when it comes to safer sex. While many of the basic principles are the same , there’s a few things to keep in mind specifically when it comes to women having sex with women.</p> <p> You want to consider physical safety and protect both of you from contracting STIs. You need to understand the risks to physical safety and how to mitigate them. You’re able to contract or transmit the same STIs through sex with women as you are through sex with men.</p> <p> I encourage everyone regardless of orientation to regularly test themselves for and remain aware of the big 5 STIs, at a minimum. These are HIV, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and HCV. Set a cycle for regular preventative testing based on your own risk factors and take the time to understand your partner’s risk factors, too. All of this should be part of a conversation about sex before you have sex .</p> <p> Physically safer sex with women involves discussing and agreeing on the use of barrier methods in line with your risk tolerance. These can include dental dams, condoms (male or female), gloves, and finger cots.</p> <p> Dental dams get their name from their use in dentistry — have you ever had a dentist isolate a tooth by stretching a large rubber square over your mouth? That’s a dental dam. Most dental dams available to consumers are made of latex. If you have a latex allergy, or you have no clue where to buy dental dams, you can also make them by cutting a condom or a glove.</p> <p> Dental dams are used during mouth-vulva (cunnilingus) or mouth-anus (anilingus) sex. You stretch out the dental dam over the area you want to lick and hold it in place with your hands. Pro-tip — apply lube to your partner’s vulva or anus before going to town on your side of the dental dam for a more pleasurable experience.</p> <p> Condoms can come in handy for a variety of activities. If you are planning to use sex toys, use a male condom on the toy and change it before moving from one person’s body to the other. Or, you can each wear your own female condom if you don’t want to pause to change the condom over.</p> <p> Gloves and finger cots — these look like tiny condoms and roll down over a single finger — are great for digital delights. You can use them anytime you want to insert hands or fingers into the body. Gloves and finger cots are particularly handy if you have rough skin, callouses, or any cuts on your hands or fingers. Pro-tip — Even if you are using gloves or finger cots, it’s still a good idea to trim and file your nails.</p> <p> In addition to using barrier methods, consider using lube as part of making sex physically safer. A high-quality lubricant prevents tears in both delicate skin and barriers, helping to further reduce the risk of STIs. Just make sure you select a lube that is compatible with the barriers you use— most of the time, that means water-based lube. You also get the added bonus that, for many women, lube enhances pleasure.</p> <p> However, there’s more to safer sex than physical safety. Emotional safety — protecting you and your partner from emotional pain — is also important and shouldn’t be overlooked. Similar to physical safety, you need to understand the risks to emotional safety and mitigate them.</p> <p> A big part of emotionally safer sex is understanding any trauma and triggers you may have around sex and sexual orientation and communicating your needs accordingly. If certain words, phrases, or activities are off-limits for you, share this with your partner! Likewise, invite your partner to share about what they need to feel emotionally safer.</p> <p> From there, the same ABCs that helped you go on dates also help foster emotional safety. Get clear about boundaries in your relationship. Manage expectations through ongoing conversations about what you both want and are hoping to experience. Discuss your relationship agreements and talk about what having sex together means to each of you.</p> <p> By caring for physical and emotional safety when you have sex, you create the context for fun, enjoyment, and pleasure. If having sex with women is new for you, a safe and trusting environment will go a long way to reducing any anxiety you feel.</p> <h2> Putting it All Together</h2> <p> With everything we’ve covered here, you have the basic information you need to go forth and date women. Fantastic!</p> <p> Except you won’t have the chance to date women if you don’t take action.</p> <p> We’ve all been there. Especially if dating women is new to you, it’s normal to spend a lot of time gathering information. Maybe you find yourself reading stories written by bisexual women, or other practical guides like this one, or watching videos, or listening to podcasts.</p> <p> It’s okay to take your time. Each of us goes through our own process. You may decide, ultimately, that you don’t want to date women and that’s okay, too!</p> <p> However, be mindful of your actions and keep checking in with yourself. Sometimes, information gathering can become a form of procrastination if it is getting in the way of taking actions you deeply want to take.</p> <p> Think about what questions still remain for you and what you’re missing to get started. You may have additional support needs — consider attending a workshop or working with a sex coach to help you in these areas.</p> <p> Before you close this tab, take a moment and decide on one action you will commit to taking. From everything covered here, what one thing will you take away and put into practice?</p> <p> Then, go and do that. All of the skills covered here get easier with practice. The more you practice, the more your confidence will grow and the more fun you’ll get to experience. If you get one step closer to the joyful sex life you desire, that is success.</p> <span> </span> <span> </span> <span> </span> <h2> An Injustice!</h2> <h3> A new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!</h3> <p> medium.com</p> <span> </span> <p> 162<span> </span> </p> <p> <span> 3</span> </p> <span> <span> </span> <p> 162<span> </span> </p> </span> <span> <span> </span> <p> 162 </p> </span> <p> <span> 3</span> </p> <span> </span> <h2> More from An Injustice! </h2> <span> Follow </span> <p> A new intersectional publication, geared towards voices, values, and identities!</p> Read more from An Injustice! <h2> Recommended from Medium</h2> <p> Tom Kuegler</p> <p> in</p> <p> P.S.
