What impresses one girl may repel another, but that's just a chance you'll have to take when you hit the dating scene. Regardless of a girl's personal preferences, there are some universal rules of dating that will help you land that second date, and maybe even a third. Read on to find out how to make your dating life a success. </p> <h2> <span> Steps</span> </h2> <h3> Part <span> 1</span> <span> Part 1 of 4: Being Your Best</span> </h3> <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/9\/94\/Tell-if-a-Guy-Is-Interested-in-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Tell-if-a-Guy-Is-Interested-in-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/9\/94\/Tell-if-a-Guy-Is-Interested-in-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg\/aid1331530-v4-728px-Tell-if-a-Guy-Is-Interested-in-You-Step-2-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 1 <b> Project confidence.</b> One of the most attractive qualities to women is palpable confidence. Girls will be interested in you if you seem to have a lot going on: you're involved in activities, you have friends, you speak your opinion, and you have long-term goals. [1] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Confidence can stem from a lot of places. You don't have to be a basketball star to attract a girl; just get involved in something that shows you at your best. What activity allows you to shine? There's a big difference between confidence and arrogance. Confident people are admired by others for their talent, but also their grace and humility. If you're confident in yourself, you won't find the need to brag about it. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/f\/f2\/Find-a-Wife-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Find-a-Wife-Step-10-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/f\/f2\/Find-a-Wife-Step-10-Version-2.jpg\/aid1331530-v4-728px-Find-a-Wife-Step-10-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Be genuine.</b> Don't pretend to be someone you aren't - girls will be able to see right through it. There's nothing wrong with reading up on a band you know a girl likes so you can have a conversation about it later, but don't pretend you know how to play the guitar unless you're prepared to play her a song at a moment's notice. Be real, and you won't have to lie.

Dress appropriately for the situation - no sleeveless shirts at a martini bar, for example - and don't overdo it with the cologne. [3] <span> <span> X</span> Expert Source <span> </span> <span> </span> Collette Gee<br> <span> Relationship Coach &amp; Certified Violence Prevention Specialist</span> <span> Expert Interview. 1 May 2020.</span> </span> [4] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> If you show up to a party dressed at your personal best and feeling confident, you'll act that way - and there's a good chance the girl you're trying to impress will forget she even has a type.

Give the girl you'd like to date a chance to be more than the cute dress and heels she's wearing. [5] <span> <span> X</span> <span> Research source</span> <span> </span> </span> Especially avoid making sexual comments about a girl's appearance when you're trying to date her. Stick to tasteful comments about her clothes, hair, or smile. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/d\/dc\/Attract-a-Woman-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\/v4-460px-Attract-a-Woman-Step-1-Version-3.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/d\/dc\/Attract-a-Woman-Step-1-Version-3.jpg\/aid1331530-v4-728px-Attract-a-Woman-Step-1-Version-3.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 2 <b> Be a sincere conversationalist.</b> Avoid pick up lines, because they don't sound sincere. When you're talking to a girl, say something you actually mean. When she responds, don't just pretend to listen, really listen, and try to move the conversation to a place that feels "real." Of course, the conversation should be appropriate for the setting. If you're in a noisy bar, the girl you're chatting up might not be in the mood to talk about personal or philosophical subjects. Still, it should be possible to say something meaningful about the music, the crowd, or the feel of the evening that shows her you're enjoying the moment with her. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/5\/5b\/Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\/v4-460px-Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-7-Version-3.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/5\/5b\/Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-7-Version-3.jpg\/aid1331530-v4-728px-Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-7-Version-3.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 3 <b> Let her get comfortable.</b> When you've just met a girl and you want to ask her on a date, it's very important that she feels comfortable being herself with you. Enjoy her quirks and unique qualities, and try not to be judgmental. If you say something critical, even in jest, it could come off the wrong way and make her close up. Ask a lot of questions and follow up with comments that let her know you're listening and care about what she's saying. Joke around to keep things fun, but avoid making fun of the girl, her friends, her family, or anything else that hurt her feelings this early in the game.

Instead, try to genuinely have a good time getting to know someone you've recently met. Think about all you have to learn about her, and all she has to learn about you. If you enjoy her company now, chances are she's enjoying yours, too. <span> {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/c\/c3\/Treat-Your-Girlfriend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Treat-Your-Girlfriend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/c\/c3\/Treat-Your-Girlfriend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg\/aid1331530-v4-728px-Treat-Your-Girlfriend-Step-7-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":" div class=\"mw-parser-output\" p License: a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\" Creative Commons \/a br \n \/p p br \/ \n \/p \/div "}</span> 3 <b> Get physical.</b> Whether you place your hand on her back while you're waiting in line for tickets, hold hands during a movie, or go back to your place after dinner, some kind of physical touch will increase the intimacy you feel with the girl you're dating.

Wear nice clothes that make you feel confident so you'll look and feel your best. Once you arrive for the date, ask her questions about the things she likes, to show you’re interested and keep the conversation flowing. For example, if she mentions she likes rock music, ask something like, “Do you go to many shows? What’s the best band you’ve seen live?” When you talk about yourself, be honest instead of trying to impress her, since girls prefer guys that are genuine. <span> For more tips, including how to follow up with a girl after your date, read on!</span> <span> </span> <span> Did this summary help you?</span> Yes No </p> In other languages <span> Español:</span> salir con una chica <span> Italiano:</span> Uscire con le Ragazze <span> Deutsch:</span> Mädchen daten <span> Français:</span> sortir avec des filles <span> Русский:</span> встречаться с девушками <span> 中文:</span> 和女孩约会 <span> Nederlands:</span> Met meiden daten <span> 日本語:</span> 女の子とデートする <span> العربية:</span> مواعدة الفتيات <span> ไทย:</span> เดทสาว <span> Tiếng Việt:</span> Hẹn hò với phụ nữ <span> 한국어:</span> 여자들과 데이트 하는 방법 <span> हिन्दी:</span> लड़कियों को डेट करें Print Send fan mail to authors Thanks to all authors for creating a page that has been read 865,572 times. <h2> <span> Reader Success Stories</span> </h2> <p> Ndi Hubert</p> <p> Jun 8, 2018</p> "What really made me feel good about this article is part one, about being confident.
